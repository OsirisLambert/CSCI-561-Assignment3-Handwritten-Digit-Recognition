# Handwritten Digit Recognition

Implementing a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural
network and use it to classify hand-written digits shown in Figure 1. You can use numerical
libraries such as Numpy/Scipy, but machine learning libraries are NOT allowed. You need to
implement feedforward/backpropagation as well as training process by yourselves.
